# COMMAND

# Scaper notes:

due to hte limited time, I could not make the scaper create request from the received arguments.
I make it like hard code for now.

# Testing
- the code is run without error on my computer however I had difficult with running this on aviary.
- my computer is running: Manjaro OS and I test my website with Brave Browser (which is almost identical to Chrome)
